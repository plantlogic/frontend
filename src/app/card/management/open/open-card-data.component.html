<p>
  For opening a card to view and then edit (if user has that permission) - will need a separate edit button to edit card info
  <br />
  Then list(s) of all tractor/irrigation data on this card, with edit buttons (if user has permission) next to each as well
  (this may require separate pages for editing these values, but it would be really cool if we could make it work inline)
