<p>
  List of all cards should be here, whether they're closed or not, with buttons to view/edit each card
  + a button to re-open cards (in case one is accidentally closed)
</p>

<button class="button button-primary" routerLink="/manage/o/cardIdHere">Open A Card</button>
<button class="button button-primary" routerLink="/manage/export">Export Data</button>
